------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- About This Project:

With the help of this database system, the management of the university will be able to keep track of the different schools in the university, the courses, the students, professors, lecturers, counselors, staff, buildings and library.
The database will help the university to keep track on how many students signed and to which school, also how many more years they have before graduating. That will help the university to keep track of the cash flow.

Furthermore, the database will help the university keep track of the budget, based on the salaries of the management, professors, lecturers, counselors and staff.
